That is how I imagine **noting application** should look and work like. I was focusing on building UI for this application. Even though there is a signup and sign in forms, they are not functional.
All in all, it was a nice refreshment on using **jQuery** again for manipulating the DOM. However, I missed the global **state** object, where I could manipulate the current state of the app easily and react to changes.

Feel free to clone the repo and make some changes. If SASS wants to be changed, make sure to install `compass` and run `$ compass watch`.
